# DL-in-NLP
I will uplaod notebooks for some essential and different techniques to do simple text calssification and its pipeline and some other different NLP tasks using DL.

## Bag Of Word Method 
it is gonna be the first Notebook we will work on imdb dataset which is already preprocessed all it need some vocabulary creation and simple vectorzation and modeling the network
### advantage of BOW
- Simple to implement and understand.
- Works well with a large corpus.
- Efficient for traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
### Limitations of BOW
- Ignores word order: Bag of Words disregards grammar and syntax, treating the document as an unordered set of words.
- High dimensionality: The size of the feature space can grow significantly as the number of unique words increases.
- Sparse matrix: Most feature vectors are sparse (contain many zeros), which can lead to inefficient memory usage.
